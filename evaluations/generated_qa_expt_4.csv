**An Ordinance Amending the Regulation of Gaming Permits**

*Section 5: Reclassification of Gaming Permits*

(a) Purpose: The reclassification of gaming permits from ""Electronic Games (E-Games)"" to ""Electronic Bingo (E-Bingo) and Traditional Bingo"" aims to align with community standards and regulatory frameworks that promote responsible gaming and community welfare.

(b) Definitions: For the purposes of this Ordinance:
   1. ""Electronic Games (E-Games)"" shall refer to any digital or electronic games of chance or skill that are not categorized under bingo or similar gaming formats.
   2. ""Electronic Bingo (E-Bingo)"" shall refer to a game of chance conducted via electronic means, where players match numbers on a screen to those drawn randomly.
   3. ""Traditional Bingo"" shall refer to the conventional game of chance utilizing physical cards and markers.

(c) Significance: The transition to E-Bingo and Traditional Bingo permits is significant for the following reasons:
   1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures adherence to updated state and local gaming regulations that differentiate between various forms of gaming to better manage licensing, oversight, and taxation.
   2. **Community Impact**: Facilitates a gaming environment that is more familiar and socially acceptable to the community, thereby enhancing local engagement and reducing potential negative repercussions associated with less regulated electronic games.
   3. **Economic Considerations**: Supports local economies by attracting a broader demographic of participants, thus contributing to increased revenue opportunities for authorized gaming establishments.

(d) Implementation: This reclassification shall take effect on January 1, 2025, during which all existing E-Games permit holders must apply for the newly designated E-Bingo and Traditional Bingo permits to continue operations legally.","[[""SP-8973, S-2022"", ""Preamble"", 0.9483275413513184], [""SP-8973, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.9426822662353516], [""SP-8978, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.9006504416465759], [""SP-8973, S-2022"", ""Operative"", 0.876344621181488], [""SP-8978, S-2022"", ""Operative"", 0.8558322191238403], [""SP-8977, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.8375641107559204], [""SP-8977, S-2022"", ""Preamble"", 0.8178324699401855]]",The significance of changing the permit from operating electronic games (E-Games) to electronic bingo (E-Bingo) and traditional bingo in Quezon City.,"[[""SP-8978, S-2022"", ""Operative"", 0.9768507480621338], [""SP-8978, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.934983491897583], [""SP-8973, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.892424464225769], [""SP-8977, S-2022"", ""Operative"", 0.8916527032852173], [""SP-8973, S-2022"", ""Operative"", 0.8913576602935791], [""SP-8977, S-2022"", ""Introduction"", 0.8564956188201904], [""SP-8978, S-2022"", ""Preamble"", 0.8371478915214539]]","**Ordinance No. 2023-45**
